# Bee md

## What is this project for?
If you hold many projects at GitHub, then you may want to create nice **md** files.
Unless you have a good md editor, you have no idea how a final md file will look.
The project fills the gap.

### 3rd party dependency
The project uses 1 dependency [commonmark](https://github.com/commonmark/commonmark.js). Checkout the project, and then copy
[bee-java.rb](bee-java.rb) there and run **rb**. Modify [env.xml]([env.xml) here to specify the dependency jar location. If you do not
want to build the *jar*, then you can take it from [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:org.commonmark).
